        <td>Think and Grow Rich is a book written by Napoleon Hill and Rosa Lee Beeland released in 1937 and promoted as a personal development and self-improvement book. He claimed to be inspired by a suggestion from business magnate and later-philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. However there is no evidence that the two ever met.

          The book is considered a classic in the personal development genre and has been widely influential in shaping the way people think about success and wealth.</td>

        <td>The Richest Man in Babylon is a 1926 book by George S. Clason that dispenses financial advice through a collection of parables set 4,097 years earlier, in ancient Babylon. The book remains in print almost a century after the parables were originally published, and is regarded as a classic of personal financial advice.</td>

        <td>It is not only the words we speak, but also the names we give or bear that have effect on our lives. Have you ever thought about the meaning of the names you bear? This book is unique in that it does not just tell you the effects of bad words or names, but also tells you how to have victory whether you are a user or a victim. You will sure find it a nugget of gold as you come to realise that “life and death are in the power of the tongue”: in other words, “Word Killeth, Word Maketh Alive”</td>
